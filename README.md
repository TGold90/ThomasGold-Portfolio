# ThomasGold-Portfolio

## Description

This is the Proto-type of my professional coding portfolio.

- The main purpose of the web page is to introduce the user to me and to showcase my works thus far as a web developer.

- It contains 4 sections: Header/Nav, About Me, Projects and Contact.

## Usage

There is a nav bar in the header at the rop right of the page that will take the User to each section.

The images under projects are active links that will take the user to the deployed application represented in the image. Though, the last 4 images are only placeholders for the time-being, as I have only truly completed one project as a web-developer to date. 

## Credits

I adopted my original Grid layout from Scott Casey, a cohort from my coding bootcamp course. For several iterations, I was using a nearly exact copy of the grid layout he showed to me. However, I eventually removed that Grid layout and made it my own. I still felt that credit was due in this situation.
